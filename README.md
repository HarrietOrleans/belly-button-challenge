Module 14 Challenge

The Module 14 challenge was fairly straight forward. I found that I was able to use class activities as examples to complete most of the project. One thing that I learned was the importance of checking code, especially the html index. My charts were not rendering and I knew that I had made an error in my code. I spent a long time checking and cleaning my code to make sure that I did not make a mistake in spelling or misplaced characters and spaces.

I had initially named my Bubble Chart id bubble-chart, and my bar chart id bar-chart. Each time I would refresh my page the charts were not rendering. I spent a long time searching online trying to figure out how I could get it to display. I tried console logging different elements, but that did not help. Finally I was directed to review my html and I noticed that ids were set to bar and bubble. Once I changed my chart ids to these ids my code worked!
